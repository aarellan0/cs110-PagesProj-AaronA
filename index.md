Hello! My name is Aaron Arellano, and I'm currently a 2nd year CS major here at UCSD, trying to learn more about software engineering!
Im from Chula Vista, while the rest of my family is from Tj. Essentially Im a first generation college student here in the US! \
When Im not programming or working on school assignments, Im either playing with my neighbors cat, attempting to draw like picasso (i fail miserably) playing playstation games, watching whatever TV show is popular, or taking mobile gaming way too seriously :) \
\
I like to consider myself as hardworking, as I always strive to put in my 100% effort! Even though most of the time I do make mistakes that in hindsight I should've averted (like mispelling a variable name countless times), I still like to find new ways of working around problems. And when that fails, I always enjoy peer communication! Getting to learn from my peers and instructors is always a very exciting experience for me, as it not only opens my eyes to the solutions of various computational problems, but it also helps me get to understand new ways of thinking. Put the academic side away, I also enjoy meeting new people in general. Its always great to meet new people with different personalities. Most often, they help me get out of my comfort zone and help me become a better person down the road.
