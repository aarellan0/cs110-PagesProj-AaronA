## About Me ##
\
Hello! My name is **Aaron Arellano**, and I'm currently a 2nd year CS major here at _UCSD_, trying to learn more about software engineering!
Im from Chula Vista, while the rest of my family is from Tj. Essentially Im a first generation college student here in the US! \
When Im not programming or working on school assignments, Im either playing with my neighbors cat, attempting to draw like picasso (i fail miserably) playing playstation games, watching whatever TV show is popular, or taking mobile gaming way too seriously :) \
\
I like to consider myself as hardworking, as I always strive to put in my 100% effort! Even though most of the time I do make mistakes that in hindsight I should've averted (like mispelling a variable name countless times), I still like to find new ways of working around problems. And when that fails, I always enjoy peer communication! Getting to learn from my peers and instructors is always a very exciting experience for me, as it not only opens my eyes to the solutions of various computational problems, but it also helps me get to understand new ways of thinking. Put the academic side away, I also enjoy meeting new people in general. Its always great to meet new people with different personalities. Most often, they help me get out of my comfort zone and help me become a better person down the road.
\
As for my ~~adequate~~ programming skills, I've used a few different technologies and programming languages. I first started learning _CS_ during my junior year of high school, that was when I was using scratch to learn the basics and fundamentals. Scratch was a fun and interactive platform that introduced me to programming concepts, such as variable declaration, loops and functions. 

\

During the second semester of my junior year, thats when I first transitioned to actual written programming languages, with my first one being python because of its simplicity and understandable syntax. Thats when I learned more complex concepts of _CS_, such as Arrays, Lists, Dictionaries, etc. I also learned a few basic features of HTML near the end of the course. This was also the first time where I wrote the famous line of code for all programmers:
```
print("Hello World!")
```

\
After that, I took **AP Computer Science A** in my senior year of high school, which was my first experience with the java programming language. The course introduced me to the syntax of the language, whilst also showing me more complicated computer concepts. For example, this course introduced me to recursion and recursive functions, the stack and heap, as well as ***Object Oriented Programming*** in general.
I continued learning about Java and foundational CS concepts during my first few quarters here at UCSD. And it wasn't until recently with CSE 30 and CSE 100 where I learned a few more programming languages, with C, C++, and the very basics of ARM assembly.
\
In this course, I hope to learn and build a strong foundation is web development with HTML, CSS and javascript. Not only that, But i'm also looking forward to learning about what makes a good software enginner, and the skills needed to be successful in the industry!
